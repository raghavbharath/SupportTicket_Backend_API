# Support Ticket Desk App

This is a Full-Stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) project I built as part of the React Front-to-Back UDEMY course by Brad Traversy. 

Some important features of this support ticket system are:
- 🔐 User Authentication (JWT-based)
- 📄 Register / Login system
- 🎫 Ticket creation, update, and closure
- 👤 User-specific ticket views
- 🧾 Protected API routes
- 📦 MongoDB database with Mongoose
- 🌐 Frontend with React & Redux Toolkit
